# Advent-of-Code-2023-Haskell

## Install Haskell

[Follow the instructions](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/)

### Test your install

Run `runghc helloworld.hs`. If it prints anything other than `Hello, World!`, it might not be installed properly.

## Contributing

Every day, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) will drop a new challenge.
We will create a new directory who's name will be the number of the day (17th December -> 17).
We will write the day's solution there.
We will also open a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Lestode/Advent-of-Code-2023-Haskell/issues) for the day
to discuss how to approach the problem.
We will try to use Haskell to solve the problems, but if it gets to complicated, we will switch to Rust.
